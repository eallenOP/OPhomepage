  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  <p>This is my website as a BIT lecturer. It'll contain all sorts of content, both linked and unlinked. You're welcome to browse the linked resources from the homepage. If you've been given a link to a resource not listed there, you will only be able to visit that page using the link provided. Hit the back button if you happen to navigate away and can't get back there.</p>
